In this work we combined network science with probabilistic inference to provide a mathematical foundation for understanding how opinion dynamics evolves in complex, decentralized systems, offering key insights for both social modeling and the design of resilient multi-agent AI."

## Overview

This collaborative project introduces a <text style='color: #4cb7feff'><b>Bayesian framework</b></text> for <text style='color: #F9D779'><b>opinion dynamics</b></text>, moving beyond deterministic models to formally <text style='color: #4cb7feff'><b>model uncertainty</b></text> within <text style='color: #4cb7feff'><b>social networks</b></text>.

### Research Goals

- **Model Uncertainty:** Treat opinions as probability distributions.
- **Heterogeneity:** Investigate the impact of network topology and information quality.
- **Consensus Dynamics:** Analyze how collective consensus evolves in complex systems.
- **Resilient AI:** Offer insights for designing resilient multi-agent AI systems.
