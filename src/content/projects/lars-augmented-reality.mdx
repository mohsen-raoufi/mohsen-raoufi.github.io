## ✨ What is LARS?
**LARS** (Light-Augmented Reality System) is a <text style='color: #4cb7feff'>standalone</text> framework engineered to provide a seamless interaction between physical collectives and virtual environments. As an end-to-end pipeline, it integrates high-speed <text style='color: #4cb7feff'>detection</text>, real-time <text style='color: #4cb7feff'>tracking</text>, and dynamic <text style='color: #4cb7feff'>projection</text> into a single, cohesive architecture. Built on a robust **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, the system enables researchers to bypass complex hardware setups and jump straight into experimentation. The core of <code style='color: #F9D779'>&lt;LARS&gt;</code> lies in its marker-free tracking engine.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **🚀 High-Speed Detection:** Real-time marker-free tracking engine.
- **🌈 Dynamic Projection:** Seamlessly project virtual environments onto physical spaces.
- **🧩 MVC Architecture:** Built on a robust Model-View-Controller pattern for modularity.
- **👶 Ease of Use:** Enables researchers to bypass complex hardware setups.
- **⚡ Performance:** Optimized with C++, Qt, and CUDA for high-frame-rate interaction.
- **🤖 Multi-Robot Support:** Track and interact with vast numbers of agents or objects simultaneously.

## 🎯 Why LARS?

- **Zero-Setup:** No need for expensive motion capture systems or dedicated markers.
- **Versatile:** Works with any camera-projector setup and any number of robots.
- **Open-Source:** Fully available for the community to assume, adapt, and advance.
- **Extensible:** Modular design allows for easy integration of new sensing or display modalities.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is designed with modularity in mind, separating the core logic (**Model**), the user interface (**View**), and the coordination layer (**Controller**). This ensures that researchers can modify tracking algorithms without breaking the UI, or swap projection techniques without rewriting the core logic.

*   **Detection Layer:** Uses OpenCV and CUDA to process video streams and identify agents.
*   **Tracking Layer:** Maintains identity and state of agents over time.
*   **Projection Layer:** Maps virtual content back onto the physical world based on agent positions.

## 🧱 Hardware Setup Overview

- **🔦 Projector:** A ceiling-mounted projector, redirected by an adjustable mirror, casts visual objects onto the arena surface, creating the augmented "world" the robots see.
- **👁️ Global Sensing for Detection and Tracking:** An overhead camera, attached to the frame, tracks robot positions, closing the loop between robots, visuals, and control software.
- **🖥️ GUI and Overhead Controller:** A side display and a controller arm provide the human interface to LARS, for starting experiments, adjusting parameters, and monitoring the system in real time.
- **🧩 Scaffolding:** An aluminum frame and enclosed base hold all components in a stable, portable structure.

## 🧑‍🔬 Example Scenarios

- **🗳️ Collective Decision-Making:** Track and visualize 100+ Kilobots in a noisy, projected environment.
- **⏰ Swarm Synchronization:** Record robot states and group dynamics in real time.
- **🕹️ Interactive Demos:** Let visitors steer/interact with swarms and see collective behavior.
- **🧑‍🏫 Educational Labs:** Manipulate real experiments to teach robotics, physics, and complexity.
