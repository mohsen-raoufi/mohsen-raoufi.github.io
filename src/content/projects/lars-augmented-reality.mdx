## Overview

<code style='color: #F9D779'>&lt;LARS&gt;</code> is a <text style='color: #4cb7feff'>standalone</text> framework engineered to provide a seamless interaction between physical collectives and virtual environments. As an end-to-end pipeline, it integrates high-speed <text style='color: #4cb7feff'>detection</text>, real-time <text style='color: #4cb7feff'>tracking</text>, and dynamic <text style='color: #4cb7feff'>projection</text> into a single, cohesive architecture.

### Key Features

- **High-Speed Detection:** Real-time marker-free tracking engine.
- **Dynamic Projection:** Seamlessly project virtual environments onto physical spaces.
- **MVC Architecture:** Built on a robust Model-View-Controller pattern for modularity.
- **Ease of Use:** Enables researchers to bypass complex hardware setups.
