title: "Emergence and Breaking of Echo Chambers in Social Systems"
description: "This research studies the challenge of echo chambers in networked systems, where homophily—the tendency to interact only with like-minded peers—prevents consensus and drives polarization. Using agent-based simulations and complex systems analysis, I modeled how these clusters emerge and explored a novel strategy to break them: 'Messengers', by utilizing a Dichotomous Markov Process. This work provides a scalable modeling and simulation framework for understanding social dynamics and multi-agent systems."

## Overview

This research studies the challenge of echo chambers in networked systems, focusing on how homophily drives polarization and prevents consensus.

### Methodology

- **Agent-Based Simulations:** Modeled the emergence of echo chambers.
- **Complex Systems Analysis:** Analyzed the dynamics of social systems.
- **Messengers Strategy:** Explored a novel strategy using a Dichotomous Markov Process to break echo chambers.
- **Scalability:** Provided a scalable framework for understanding social dynamics.
