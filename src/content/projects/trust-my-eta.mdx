## 🚀 Functional Summary

**TrustMyETA** is a travel time prediction system that calculates a **"Trust Score"** for any given route. Instead of a single ETA, it provides a probabilistic arrival time range based on risk factors.

*   **Core Logic**: Uses **Monte Carlo Simulation** (1000 iterations) to model travel variability.
*   **Input Vectors**: Analyzes Route Geometry (tortuosity), real-time Weather (snow, visibility), and Traffic patterns.
*   **Output**: A normalized Reliability Score (0-100%), P95 (worst-case) arrival time, and categorized risk factors (Safe/Caution/High).
*   **Demo Mode**: Features a fail-safe "Demo Mode" that serves pre-calculated mock data for specific presets (Berlin, Moscow, LA) to demonstrate functionality without a live backend connection.

## 💻 Technical Stack & Skills Deployed

The project demonstrates proficiency in **Modern Frontend Engineering**, **Geospatial Analysis**, and **System Architecture**.

### Frontend Ecosystem
*   **Framework**: React 19 + Vite (High-performance build tooling).
*   **Language**: TypeScript (Strict typing for robust domain modeling).
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first, responsive design).
*   **Visualization**: Recharts (Statistical data plotting) & React-Leaflet (Interactive mapping).
*   **State Management**: Complex async state handling for simulation lifecycles.

### Backend & Data Science Concepts
*   **Architecture**: Node.js / Fastify (REST API).
*   **Validation**: Zod (Schema validation for API contracts).
*   **Algorithms**: Implemented Monte Carlo statistical modeling and standard deviation analysis in TypeScript.
*   **Simulation**: Created mock services (MockTraffic, MockWeather) to decouple frontend from expensive external APIs during development/demo.

### DevOps & Deployment
*   **CI/CD**: Implemented GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment.
*   **Hosting Strategy**: Static site deployment to **GitHub Pages**.
    *   Utilized `gh-pages` branch strategy for security (deploying only `dist` artifacts).
    *   Configured distinct build scripts (`predeploy`, `deploy`) to ensure valid production builds.
*   **Asset Management**: Optimization of static assets and custom bundle configuration.

## 🏆 Key Achievements

*   **Mocking Strategy**: Successfully architected a hybrid app that behaves dynamically but can be hosted statically by intercepting API calls for demo presets.
*   **UX Engineering**: Designed a "Mission Control" interface with high-fidelity animations and clear visual hierarchy for complex statistical data.
*   **Resilience**: Implemented robust error handling and fallback UI for environments where the backend is unreachable.
