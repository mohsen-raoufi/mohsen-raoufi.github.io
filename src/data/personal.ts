    title: "Researcher & Systems Engineer",
    description: "Hey there! From collective robots to opinion dynamics on social networks, I am fascinated by collective, complex, dynamic systems. I am interested in studying, understanding, and designing these systems using network science, control theory, and agent-based modeling approaches.",
    journey: "I received my master’s in Dynamics and Control, with a thesis on 'developing a state estimation for nonlinear systems using a swarm-based optimization algorithm.' Currently, as a doctoral researcher at the cluster 'Science of Intelligence', I work on 'Speed-Accuracy Tradeoffs in Collective Estimation'. My research focuses on how network structure and adaptive decision-making policies change collective behavior, particularly the balance between speed and accuracy.",
    skills: ["C++", "Python", "Julia", "Matlab", "Robotics", "Collective Intelligence"],
    heroDescription: "Exploring collective intelligence, AI, robotics, networks, and distributed systems.",
