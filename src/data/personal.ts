        "Hey there!",
        "I am an <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">AI Engineer</strong> and <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">Robotics Specialist</strong> fascinated by the behavior of complex, dynamic systems. I believe that to truly understand a system, you have to build it yourself—a philosophy that has guided my decade-long journey from the optimization of intelligent agents to the engineering of collective robotics. With a rigorous engineering mindset and a deep background in <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">dynamics</strong>, <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">state estimation</strong>, and <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">control</strong>, I specialize in the full lifecycle of intelligent systems: from mathematical modeling and data-driven simulation to real-world deployment.",
        // 
        "I am scaling my expertise into <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">AI-driven automation</strong> and full-stack development, bringing a diverse background in complexity to the creation of scalable software architectures. My focus is on managing the entire development cycle—integrating data science backend logic with functional front-end interfaces and rigorous testing frameworks. I have become the person people go to for solving the most intricate challenges, delivering precise, engineering-based solutions that transform complex data into resilient, end-to-end intelligent technologies."
