        "Hey there!",
        "I am an <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">AI Engineer</strong> and <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">Robotics Specialist</strong> interested in learning, control, and dynamics of complex systems. I am driven by a simple belief: to truly understand a system, you have to build it yourself. This principle has shaped my decade-long practice of designing, implementing, and deploying intelligent systems, from high-performance controllers and decentralized learning algorithms to embodied robotic collectives. With a background in <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">dynamics</strong>, <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">state estimation</strong>, and <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">control</strong>, I specialize in the full lifecycle of intelligent systems: from mathematical modeling and data-driven simulation to real-world deployment.",
        "These days, I am extending my expertise into <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">AI-driven automation</strong> and full-stack development. My focus is on managing the entire development cycle—integrating data science backend logic with functional front-end interfaces and testing frameworks. I have become the person people go to for solving intricate challenges end to end."

        academic_about: [
            "My academic path began with a deep interest in engineering and the dynamics and control of <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">complicated</text> mechanical systems. During my B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering and M.Sc. in Dynamics and Control—where I received the National Best Thesis award for my work on heuristic nonlinear state estimation—I developed a strong foundation in system dynamics, modeling, and estimation. This early work shaped my engineering mindset and my preference for approaches that are both theoretically grounded and implementable.",
            "Over time, my focus expanded from individual engineered systems to the emergent behavior of <strong style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">complex</strong> and distributed systems. I became interested in how simple local interactions can give rise to collective intelligence. This shift led me to doctoral research at the <em>Science of Intelligence</em> Cluster of Excellence, where I studied collective estimation and opinion dynamics over networks.",
            "My Ph.D. research investigated how factors such as individuality, uncertainty, and network heterogeneity fundamentally shape collective behavior. Throughout this work, I consistently iterated between theory and practice by implementing decentralized models in simulations and on physical robotic collectives, ensuring that abstract insights translate into <strong style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">embodied intelligence</strong>."

            `I have spent the last decade combining research with a hands-on approach to engineering. I pride myself on being both a <strong class="text-[#8fd9fb]">researcher</strong> and the <strong class="text-[#8fd9fb]">go-to person</strong> for solving complex, practical challenges that require more than just a theoretical answer. My work experience ranges from leading robotic teams in competitions to developing test-beds for research purposes, such as <a href="${import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/$/, "")}/project/lars-augmented-reality"><code style='color: #F9D779'>&lt;LARS&gt;</code></a> (Light Augmented Reality System), where I pipelined the detection, tracking, and projection into a single end-to-end software framework combining <code class="font-mono text">OpenCV with CUDA</code>, <code class="font-mono text">Qt Application</code>, for <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">human-robot interaction</text>. I have engineered everything from low-level motor <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">control</text> for soccer robots, to <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">modeling</text>, <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">estimation</text>, and <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">control</text> of non-linear engineering systems, to agent-based simulations of complex opinion dynamics, always ensuring that my code is as robust in the real world as it is in a simulation environment.`,
