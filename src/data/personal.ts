        "Hey there!",
        "I am an <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">AI Engineer</strong> and <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">Robotics Specialist</strong> fascinated by the behavior of complex, dynamic systems. I believe that to truly understand a system, you have to build it yourself—a philosophy that has guided my decade-long journey from the optimization of intelligent agents to the engineering of collective robotics. With a rigorous engineering mindset and a deep background in <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">dynamics</strong>, <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">state estimation</strong>, and <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">control</strong>, I specialize in the full lifecycle of intelligent systems: from mathematical modeling and data-driven simulation to real-world deployment.",
        "Currently, I am scaling my expertise into <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">AI-driven automation</strong> and full-stack development, bringing a diverse background in complexity to the creation of scalable software architectures. My focus is on managing the entire development cycle—integrating data science backend logic with functional front-end interfaces and rigorous testing frameworks. I have become the person people go to for solving the most intricate challenges, delivering precise, engineering-based solutions that transform complex data into resilient, end-to-end intelligent technologies."

        academic_about: [
            "My academic foundation is built on a deep dive into the physics of movement and coordination. After completing my B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering and M.Sc. in Dynamics and Control, where I achieved a National Best Thesis on heuristic nonlinear state-estimation, I earned my Ph.D. at the Technical University of Berlin. My doctoral research at the Research Cluster of Excellence, 'Science of Intelligence' explored how factors such as individuality, uncertainty differences, and network heterogeneity changes the collective estimation and opinion dynamics on netowrks.",

            "Over the last 10 years, I have transitioned from a researcher to a <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">'go-to'</strong> problem solver for complex technical challenges. My work experience ranges from leading robotic teams to victory in national competitions to developing the <code class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">\<LARS\></code> (Light Augmented Reality System), where I achieved 37 FPS (near) real-time tracking for over 100 robots using <code class=\"font-mono text\">C++</code>, <code class=\"font-mono text\">Qt</code>, <code class=\"font-mono text\">OpenCV</code>, and <code class=\"font-mono text\">CUDA</code>. I have engineered everything from low-level motor control for soccer robots to large-scale simulations for collective opinion dynamics, always ensuring that my code is as robust in the real world as it is in a simulation environment.",
