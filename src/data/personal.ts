I believe that to truly understand a system, you have to build it yourself—a philosophy that has guided my decade-long journey from the optimization of intelligent agents to the engineering of collective robotics. With a rigorous engineering mindset and a deep background in <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">dynamics</strong>, <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">state estimation</strong>, and <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">control</strong>, I specialize in the full lifecycle of intelligent systems: from mathematical modeling and data-driven simulation to real-world deployment.",
        "Currently, I am scaling my expertise into <strong class=\"text-[#8fd9fb]\">AI-driven automation</strong> and full-stack development, bringing a diverse background in complexity to the creation of scalable software architectures. My focus is on managing the entire development cycle—integrating data science backend logic with functional front-end interfaces and rigorous testing frameworks. I have become the person people go to for solving the most intricate challenges, delivering precise, engineering-based solutions that transform complex data into resilient, end-to-end intelligent technologies."

        academic_about: [
            "My academic career began with a fascination for engineering systems and the dynamics and control of <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">complicated</text> mechanical structures. During my B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering and M.Sc. in Dynamics and Control—where I received the National Best Thesis award for my work on heuristic nonlinear state-estimation—I developed a deep understanding system dynamics and behavior. As I progressed, my focus shifted toward the emergent intelligence of <strong style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">complex</strong> systems. I began exploring how simple local rules can solve large-scale problems, such as collective movement and distributed pollution cleanup. This path led to my doctoral research at the 'Science of Intelligence' Cluster of Excellence (TU Berlin), where I transitioned into the study of complexity in distributed learning. My Ph.D. focused on the dynamics of opinions over decentralized networks, where I modeled how factors like individuality, uncertainty differences, and network heterogeneity fundamentally alter collective behavior. Throughout this work, I have maintained a bridge between theory and reality by implementing these decentralized models on physical robotic collectives, ensuring that mathematical insights translate into robust, <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">embodied intelligence.</text>",

            `I have spent the last decade combining rigorous research with a hands-on approach to engineering. I pride myself on being both a researcher and the <strong class="text-[#8fd9fb]">go-to person</strong> for solving complex, practical challenges that require more than just a theoretical answer. My work experience ranges from leading robotic teams in competitions to developing test-beds for research purposes, such as <a href="${import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/$/, "")}/project/lars-augmented-reality"><code style='color: #F9D779'>&lt;LARS&gt;</code></a> (Light Augmented Reality System), where I pipelined the detection, tracking, and projection into a single end-to-end software framework combining <code class="font-mono text">OpenCV with CUDA</code>, <code class="font-mono text">Qt Application</code>, for <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">human-robot interaction</text>. I have engineered everything from low-level motor <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">control</text> for soccer robots, to <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">modeling</text>, <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">estimation</text>, and <text style=\"color: #8fd9fb\">control</text> of non-linear engineering systems, to agent-based simulations of complex opinion dynamics, always ensuring that my code is as robust in the real world as it is in a simulation environment.`,
