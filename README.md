## About Me

Hello! My name is Mohsen, I am passionate about studying systems, particularly, collectives, and understanding their dynamics. I love to share what I do for my research. Here on my GitHub profile, you will find a collection of my projects, contributions, and experiments in various areas of software development. Most projects have something to do with Robots, Networks, Agent-Based Models, Collectives, and things in between. Feel Free to reach out to me.
