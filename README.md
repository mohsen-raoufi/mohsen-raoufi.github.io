## About Me

Hi, I’m Mohsen. I work on complex systems and spend a lot of time thinking about how collectives behave and how their dynamics emerge.

Most of what I do is somehow between AI, systems engineering, and hands-on research. I enjoy building end-to-end prototypes, connecting models, data, and real systems, and turning ideas into things that actually run. Lately, I’ve been especially interested in AI automation, learning-based methods, and how data-driven approaches play with more structured, model-based systems.

This GitHub profile is a home for experiments, tools, and side projects across collective intelligence, AI, robotics, networks, and distributed systems. In one way or another, most of the repositories here are about understanding systems by building them..
